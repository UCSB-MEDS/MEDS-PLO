::: {.callout-note}
## All Post-MEDS respondents were directed to answer Question 26b, as compared to the `r q26a_not1_pre`/`r q26a_num_answers_pre` respondents in the Pre-MEDS PLO assessment.

- **Pre-MEDS: `r q26a_not1_pre`/`r q26a_num_answers_pre` student respondents (`r round((q26a_not1_pre/q26a_num_answers_pre)*100, 1)`%)** chose a familiarity level of 2 or greater, and therefore were directed to answer Question 26b. Those who answered "1" (`r q26a_1_pre` students) were jumped directly to Question 27 â€“ these non-responses are missing from the Question 26b plot, below, which is why percentages for the Pre-MEDS assessment do not add up to 100%.

- **Post-MEDS: `r q26a_not1_post`/`r q26a_num_answers_post` student respondents (`r round((q26a_not1_post/q26a_num_answers_post)*100, 1)`%)** chose a familiarity level of 2 or greater, and therefore were directed to answer Question 26b.
