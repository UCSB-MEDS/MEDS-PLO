## All Post-MEDS respondents were directed to answer Question 19b, as compared to  `r q19a_not1_pre` / `r q19a_num_answers_pre` respondents in the Pre-MEDS PLO Assessment.

- **Pre-MEDS: `r q19a_not1_pre`/`r q19a_num_answers_pre` student respondents (`r round((q19a_not1_pre/q19a_num_answers_pre)*100, 1)`%)** chose a familiarity level of 2 or greater, and therefore were directed to answer question 19b.

- **Post-MEDS: `r q19a_not1_post`/`r q19a_num_answers_post` student respondents (`r round((q19a_not1_post/q19a_num_answers_post)*100, 1)`%)** chose a familiarity level of 2 or greater, and therefore were directed to answer question 19b.
