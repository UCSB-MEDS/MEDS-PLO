::: {.callout-note}
## All X Post-MEDS respondents were directed to answer Question 18b, as compared to `r q18a_not1_pre`/`r q18a_num_answers_pre` respondents in the Pre-MEDS PLO Assessment.

- **Pre-MEDS: `r q18a_not1_pre`/`r q18a_num_answers_pre` student respondents (`r round((q18a_not1_pre/q18a_num_answers_pre)*100, 1)`%)** chose a familiarity level of 2 or greater, and therefore were directed to answer Question 18b. Those who selected a familiarity level of 1 (`r q18a_1_pre` students) were jumped directly to Question 19.
