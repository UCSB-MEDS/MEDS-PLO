::: {.callout-note}
## All Post-MEDS respondents were directed to answer Question 20c, as compared to the `r q20b_yes_pre`/`r q20b_total_answers_pre` respondents in the Pre-MEDS PLO Assessment.

- **Pre-MEDS: `r q20b_yes_pre`/`r q20b_total_answers_pre` student respondents (`r round((q20b_yes_pre/q20b_total_answers_pre)*100, 1)`%)** answered "Yes" to Question 20b, and therefore were directed to answer Question 20c. Those who answered "No" (`r q20a_no_pre` students) were jumped directly to Question 21. 

- **Post-MEDS: `r q20b_yes_post`/`r q20b_total_answers_post` student respondents (`r round((q20b_yes_post/q20b_total_answers_post)*100, 1)`%)** answered "Yes" to Question 20b, and therefore were directed to answer Question 20c.
