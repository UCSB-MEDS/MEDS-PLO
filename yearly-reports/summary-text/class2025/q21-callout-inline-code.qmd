::: {.callout-note}
## All `q21a_not1_post`/`q21a_num_answers_post` Post-MEDS respondents were directed to answer Questions 21b & 21c, as compared to the `q21a_not1_pre`/`q21a_num_answers_pre` respondents in the Pre-MEDS PLO assessment.

- **Pre-MEDS: `r q21a_not1_pre`/`r q21a_num_answers_pre` student respondents (`r round((q21a_not1_pre/q21a_num_answers_pre)*100, 1)`%)** chose a familiarity level of 2 or greater, and therefore were directed to answer Questions 21b & 21c. Those who answered “1” (`r q21a_1_pre` students) were jumped directly to Question 22.

- **Post-MEDS: `q21a_not1_post`/`q21a_num_answers_post` student respondents (`round((q21a_not1_post/q21a_num_answers_post)*100, 1)`%)** answered "Yes" to Question 21a, and therefore were directed to answer Questions 21b & 21c.
