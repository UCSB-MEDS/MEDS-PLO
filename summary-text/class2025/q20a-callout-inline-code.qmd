::: {.callout-note}
## All X Post-MEDS respondents were directed to answer Question 20b, as compared to the `r q20a_yes_pre`/`r q20a_num_answers_pre` respondents in the Pre-MEDS PLO Assessment.

- **Pre-MEDS: `r q20a_yes_pre`/`r q20a_num_answers_pre` student respondents (`r round((q20a_yes_pre/q20a_num_answers_pre)*100, 1)`%)** answered "Yes" to Question 20a, and therefore were directed to answer Question 20b. Those who selected answered "No" (`r q20a_no_pre` students) were jumped directly to Question 21.

<!-- ::: {.callout-note} -->
<!-- ## Students who responded **"No"** to Question 20a skip directly to Question 21.  -->

<!-- Those respondents are recorded as `NA` or `No response` in Questions 20b & 20c. -->
