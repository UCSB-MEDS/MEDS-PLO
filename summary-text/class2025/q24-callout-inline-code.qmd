::: {.callout-note}
## `q24a_not1_post`/`q24a_num_answers_post` Post-MEDS respondents were directed to answer Question 24b, as compared to the `r q24a_not1_pre`/`r q24a_num_answers_pre` respondents in the Pre-MEDS PLO Assessment.

- **Pre-MEDS: `r q24a_not1_pre`/`r q24a_num_answers_pre` student respondents (`r round((q24a_not1_pre/q24a_num_answers_pre)*100, 1)`%)** chose a familiarity level of 2 or greater, and therefore were directed to answer Question 24b. Those who answered "1" (`r q24a_1_pre` students) were jumped directly to Question 25. 

- **Post-MEDS: `q24a_not1_post`/`q24a_num_answers_post` student respondents (`round((q24a_not1_post/q24a_num_answers_post)*100, 1)`%)** chose a familiarity level of 2 or greater, and therefore were directed to answer Question 24b. Those who answered "1" (`q24a_1_post` student) were jumped directly to Question 25.
