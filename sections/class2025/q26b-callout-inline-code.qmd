::: {.callout-note}
## All `q26b_not1_post`/`q26b_num_answers_post` Post-MEDS respondents were directed to answer Question 26c, as compared to the `q26b_not1_pre`/`q26b_num_answers_pre` respondents in the Pre-MEDS PLO assessment.

- **Pre-MEDS: `r q26b_not1_pre`/`r q26b_num_answers_pre` student respondents (`r round((q26b_not1_pre/q26b_num_answers_pre)*100, 1)`%)** chose a familiarity level of 2 or greater, and therefore were directed to answer Question 26c. Those who answered "1" (`r q26b_1_pre` students) were jumped directly to Question 27 â€“ these non-responses are missing from the Question 26c plot, below, which is why percentages for the Pre-MEDS assessment do not add up to 100%.

- **Post-MEDS: `q26b_not1_post`/`q26b_num_answers_post` student respondents (`round((q26b_not1_post/q26b_num_answers_post)*100, 1)`%)** chose a familiarity level of 2 or greater, and therefore were directed to answer Question 26c.
