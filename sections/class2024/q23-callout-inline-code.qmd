::: {.callout-note}
## All `r q23a_not1_post`/`r q23a_num_answers_post` Post-MEDS respondents were directed to answer Question 23b, as compared to the `r q23a_not1_pre`/`r q23a_num_answers_pre` respondents in the Pre-MEDS PLO assessment.

- **Pre-MEDS: `r q23a_not1_pre`/`r q23a_num_answers_pre` student respondents (`r round((q23a_not1_pre/q23a_num_answers_pre)*100, 1)`%)** chose a familiarity level of 2 or greater, and therefore were directed to answer Question 23b. Those who answered "1" (`r q22a_1_pre` students) were jumped directly to Question 24.

- **Post-MEDS: `r q23a_not1_post`/`r q23a_num_answers_post` student respondents (`r round((q23a_not1_post/q23a_num_answers_post)*100, 1)`%)** chose a familiarity level of 2 or greater, and therefore were directed to answer Question 23b.
