::: {.callout-note}
## All respondents advanced to Question 18b post-MEDS, as compared to `r q18a_not1_pre`/`r q18a_num_answers_pre` respondents pre-MEDS

**`r q18a_not1_pre`/ `r q18a_num_answers_pre` student respondents (`r round((q18a_not1_pre/q18a_num_answers_pre)*100, 1)`%)** chose a familiarity level of 2 or greater â€“ these respondents were directed to answer Question 18b. `r q18a_1_pre` respondents selected **1 (never heard of it)** in response to Question 18a and were jumped directly to Question 19 -- they are recorded as `NA` in question 18b, below.
