::: {.callout-note}
## `r q25b_not1` / `r q25b_num_answers` respondents advanced to Question 25b
**`r q25b_not1` / `r q25b_num_answers` student respondents (`r ((q25b_not1/q25a_num_answers)*100)`%)** chose a familiarity level of 2 or greater â€“ these respondents were directed to answer Question 25b. `r q25a_1` respondents selected **1 (definitely not)** in response to Question 25b and were jumped directly to Question 26 -- they are recorded as `NULL` in Question 25c, below.
